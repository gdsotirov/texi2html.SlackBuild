texi2html: Texi2HTML (An Open Source Texinfo to HTML Conversion Script)
texi2html:
texi2html: Texi2HTML is a Perl script which converts Texinfo source files to
texi2html: HTML output, licensed under the GNU General Public License,
texi2html: version 2, or any later version.
texi2html: The program takes Texinfo files (not info ones) and produces a set
texi2html: of HTML files.  The quality of the output is close to the printed
texi2html: output and is much better than an info->HTML gateway.
texi2html: Compared to the output of `makeinfo --html', texi2html's output is
texi2html: more customizable and (subjectively) produces better output by
texi2html: default.
